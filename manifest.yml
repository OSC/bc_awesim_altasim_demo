  This app provides the following [AltaSim] apps:

  **BolometerSIM** solves the thermo-electric problem of an infra-red bolometer
  device. Incident radiation causes a temperature rise in a thermally insulated
  conducting absorber mounted on an insulating dielectric heat sink.

  **EMMirrorSIM** calculates the reflectance of a dielectric mirror consisting
  of a number of identical dielectric bi-layers with high and low refractive
  indices.

  **MieSIM** solves Maxwell's equations for scattering of electromagnetic
  radiation by spherical dielectric particles and provides the basis for
  measuring the size of particles in the atmosphere, oil droplet in water, and
  cell nuclei in biological systems.

  **PeltierSIM** simulates the thermo-electric behavior for the conversion of
  heat into electricity or electricity into heat and is described by three
  related mechanisms: the Seebeck, Peltier and Thomson effects.

  **SPRSIM** simulates the behavior of surface plasmons propagating at the
  interface between two materials for the two commonly used configurations for
  plasmon excitation: the Kretschmann-Raether and Otto configurations.

  **&mu;WaveSIM** solves the heat transfer problem associated with an
  electromagnetic field inside a cavity containing a single waveguide.
